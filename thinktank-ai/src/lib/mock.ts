    directExplanation:
      "**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function solves a problem by calling a smaller copy of itself. Every recursive solution requires two critical parts:\n\n1. **Base Case**: The stopping condition that prevents infinite looping (e.g., `if (n <= 1) return 1`).\n2. **Recursive Step**: Breaking the problem into a smaller subproblem (e.g., `return n * factorial(n - 1)`).\n\nThink of Russian nesting dolls — you keep opening smaller dolls until you hit the smallest solid wooden doll (the base case), then close them back up.",
    explorer: [
      "**Recursion** is when a function solves a big problem by delegating smaller copies of the same task to itself — just like Russian nesting dolls! You keep opening smaller dolls until you reach the solid one in the center (the *base case*). If you were writing a countdown from 5 to 1, what do you think the function should do when it hits 1?",
      "Think of recursion like standing between two mirrors: the reflections go on forever unless something stops them. In code, that stopper is called the **base case**. What would happen to your computer if a recursive function forgot its base case?",
      "A great mental model for recursion is delegating: if you need to count 100 people in a line, you just ask the person in front of you 'what is your number + 1?' and they ask the next person until someone hits person #1! How does that feel compared to a regular loop?",
    ],
    challenger: [
      "Now that we know recursion breaks tasks into smaller sub-problems: when would you choose recursion over a simple `for` or `while` loop, and what's the memory cost of each recursive call?",

    critic: [
      "Here's the most common trap with recursion: **Stack Overflow**. If your base case condition isn't reached (e.g. subtracting 2 when input is odd, or forgetting negative numbers), the call stack runs out of memory. How would you test your base case for edge inputs?",
      "Look closely at the state being passed: if a recursive call modifies a shared object without passing new arguments, it can cause unexpected mutations. Always check if each recursive call receives an independent, smaller sub-problem.",
      "Check your return types: in recursive branches, forgetting to `return` the recursive call (e.g., just writing `solve(n-1)` instead of `return solve(n-1)`) will return `undefined` back up the chain.",
